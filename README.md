# Description
For Database management we learned how to utilize SQL to query and create databases starting from ER,EER, relational diagrams. This is an application that showcases our efforts in implementing a database, and repurposing my UTD hackathon backend, to allow for an interactive experience with my groups database

# Database Management ABC_Company Final Project
<div style="text-align: center;">
## **Problem Description**
</div>
This project focuses on designing a database system for ABC Company, a business that manages employees, customers, vendors, and products while streamlining its operations. The goal is to capture everything from employee management and job applications to product sales and vendor relationships, all in one place.

The database is already structured to enforce data integrity with primary and foreign keys, cascading deletions, and constraints on values like grades and credit ratings. From here, the task is to expand functionality by implementing views and queries to answer key questions, such as identifying top-selling products or employees with no supervisees.

This project is about taking the foundation we’ve built and extending it into a fully functional system. It’s designed to handle all of the company’s core operations while keeping the data clean, organized, and ready for analysis.
